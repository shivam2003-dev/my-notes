## D01 - Secure User Mapping	
Most often the application within the container runs with the default administrative privileges: root. This violates the least privilege principle and gives an attacker better chances further extending his activities if he manages to break out of the application into the container. From the host perspective the application should never run as root.

---
Running an application in a container as the `root` user is a common security issue, violating the principle of least privilege. To mitigate this, you can ensure the application runs as a non-root user within the container.

Here's a step-by-step guide with an example `Dockerfile` to address this issue:

---

### Steps to Mitigate Running as Root
1. **Create a Non-Root User:** Define a non-root user and group within the `Dockerfile`.
2. **Set File Ownership and Permissions:** Ensure files and directories have the correct permissions for the non-root user.
3. **Switch to the Non-Root User:** Use the `USER` instruction in the `Dockerfile` to switch from the root user.
4. **Verify Entry Point and Application Behavior:** Ensure your application doesn't require root privileges to run.
5. **Use Seccomp, AppArmor, or Capabilities (Optional):** Implement additional controls to restrict the container's access to host resources.

### Example `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use an official base image
FROM node:16

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Create a non-root user and group
RUN groupadd -g 1001 appgroup && \
    useradd -u 1001 -g appgroup -s /bin/bash -m appuser

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .

# Change ownership of the application files
RUN chown -R appuser:appgroup /usr/src/app

# Switch to the non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

### Explanation of Key Steps
1. **Create a Non-Root User:**
   - The `RUN groupadd` and `useradd` commands create a dedicated non-root user and group with specific IDs (e.g., 1001). Avoid using default IDs like `1000` to prevent conflicts.

2. **Set File Ownership and Permissions:**
   - Use `chown` to set ownership of files and directories to the non-root user (`appuser`) and group (`appgroup`).

3. **Switch User:**
   - The `USER appuser` instruction ensures all subsequent commands, including the application runtime, execute as the non-root user.

4. **Avoiding Default Root User:**
   - By default, Docker containers run as `root`, which can lead to privilege escalation if exploited. This mitigation ensures the container operates with reduced privileges.

---

### Testing and Validation
- **Run the Container:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t secure-app .
  docker run -p 3000:3000 secure-app
  ```

- **Verify the Running User:**
  Inside the container, check the current user:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container_id> whoami
  ```
  It should output `appuser` (or the name of your non-root user).

---

### Additional Best Practices
- **Use Minimal Base Images:** Use lightweight images like `distroless` or `alpine` to reduce the attack surface.
- **Drop Capabilities:** Remove unnecessary Linux capabilities.
- **Read-Only Root Filesystem:** Set the container's filesystem to read-only where possible.
  ```bash
  docker run --read-only secure-app
  ```

By following these steps, you align with best practices for container security and ensure the application operates with minimal privileges.
