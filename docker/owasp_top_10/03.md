## D03 - Network Segmentation and Firewalling
You properly need to design your network upfront. Management interfaces from the orchestration tool and especially network services from the host are crucial and need to be protected on a network level. Also make sure that all other network based microservices are only exposed to the legitimate consumer of this microservice and not to the whole network.

### Mitigating D03 - Network Segmentation and Firewalling

To protect management interfaces, network services, and microservices in a containerized environment, you need to implement robust **network segmentation** and **firewalling** strategies. These measures reduce the attack surface, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure that only legitimate traffic flows between components.

### Steps to Mitigate Network Security Risks

#### 1. **Design the Network Architecture:**
   - Segment the network into zones (e.g., management, application, and database zones).
   - Isolate sensitive workloads by placing them in separate VLANs or subnets.
   - Use **private subnets** for internal communication and expose only necessary services publicly.

#### 2. **Restrict Access to Management Interfaces:**
   - Restrict access to orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes API, Docker daemon) to trusted IPs or subnets.
   - Use VPNs, bastion hosts, or jump boxes for secure access.

#### 3. **Use Container Network Policies:**
   - Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies or equivalent tools to control traffic between pods and namespaces.
   - Define ingress and egress rules for each microservice.

#### 4. **Secure Service Exposure:**
   - Use reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX) or API gateways to control and filter external access.
   - Expose only essential ports and services to the public network.

#### 5. **Enable Firewalls:**
   - Use host-level firewalls (e.g., iptables, ufw) and cloud provider network security groups (NSGs) to restrict traffic.
   - Apply **least privilege** principles to firewall rules.

#### 6. **Encrypt Traffic:**
   - Use TLS/SSL for all internal and external communications.
   - Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication.

### Example Network Policies in Kubernetes

Here's an example Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` to enforce communication rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-access
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: api
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
```

### Explanation:
- **Ingress Rules:** Restrict incoming traffic to the app from:
  - IP range `192.168.1.0/24`.
  - Pods in namespaces labeled `role: frontend`.
  - Pods with the label `role: api`.
- **Egress Rules:** Restrict outgoing traffic to:
  - Database on `10.0.0.0/16` subnet and port `5432`.

### Example Firewall Rule in AWS Security Groups

For a containerized web app and database:
1. **Web App Security Group:**
   - Ingress: Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) only from trusted IPs.
   - Egress: Allow access to the database on port 5432.

2. **Database Security Group:**
   - Ingress: Allow traffic only from the web app security group.
   - Egress: Restrict all outbound traffic.

### CI/CD Pipeline for Network Testing

1. **Add Scanning Tools:**
   - Use tools like **Calico**, **Cilium**, or **Weave Net** to test Kubernetes network policies.
   - Integrate **nmap** or **ZAP** to check for exposed ports during the CI/CD process.

2. **Example CI/CD Network Validation Step:**

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     validate-network:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Verify Network Policies
           run: kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml

         - name: Scan for Open Ports
           run: nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 192.168.1.100
   ```

### Additional Best Practices

- **Namespace Isolation:**
  - Separate applications into different namespaces and enforce strict NetworkPolicies.
  
- **Ingress Controllers and API Gateways:**
  - Use ingress controllers (e.g., Traefik, NGINX) to centralize access control.
  
- **DNS Security:**
  - Limit DNS resolution to prevent lateral movement.

- **Zero Trust Architecture:**
  - Implement authentication and authorization for every network request.

- **Log and Monitor Traffic:**
  - Use tools like **ELK Stack**, **Prometheus**, or **Sysdig** to monitor traffic and detect anomalies.

 By implementing a well-designed network segmentation and firewalling strategy, you can significantly improve your application's security posture. Properly configured networks ensure only legitimate traffic flows, reducing the risk of lateral movement and unauthorized access.
