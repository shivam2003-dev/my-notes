### Mitigating D04 - Secure Defaults and Hardening

Ensuring secure defaults and hardening is crucial for reducing the attack surface in your containerized environment. This involves removing unnecessary components, securely configuring required services, and applying best practices to lock down hosts, container images, and orchestration tools.

---

### Steps to Mitigate Risks with Secure Defaults and Hardening

#### 1. **Choose Minimal Base Images:**
   - Use minimal and purpose-built images (e.g., `distroless`, `alpine`) to reduce attack surfaces.
   - Avoid including unnecessary tools like compilers or package managers in production images.

#### 2. **Harden the Host System:**
   - Disable unneeded services on the host OS.
   - Regularly apply updates and patches.
   - Use security benchmarks like the **CIS Docker Benchmark** for guidance.

#### 3. **Limit Container Privileges:**
   - Do not run containers as `root` (aligns with D01 - Secure User Mapping).
   - Set the `USER` directive in the `Dockerfile` to use a non-root user.
   - Use runtime flags to restrict capabilities:
     ```bash
     docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE --read-only ...
     ```

#### 4. **Restrict Resource Usage:**
   - Use cgroups to limit CPU, memory, and disk usage.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" myapp
     ```

#### 5. **Enable Immutable File Systems:**
   - Mount the container's filesystem as read-only.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker run --read-only -v /app/uploads ...
     ```

#### 6. **Secure Orchestration Tools:**
   - Configure Kubernetes with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict permissions.
   - Enable admission controllers like `PodSecurityPolicy` or `OPA/Gatekeeper`.
   - Avoid using default or overly permissive namespaces (e.g., `default`).

#### 7. **Harden the Container Runtime:**
   - Use Dockerâ€™s `--seccomp` profile to restrict syscalls.
   - Enable AppArmor or SELinux for mandatory access control.

#### 8. **Scan and Monitor Containers:**
   - Use tools like **Trivy**, **Aqua Security**, or **Clair** to scan images for vulnerabilities.
   - Continuously monitor runtime behavior for anomalies using tools like **Falco** or **Sysdig**.

### Example Hardened Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use a minimal base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Add essential packages only
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    ca-certificates && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set a non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appgroup && useradd -r -g appgroup appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Set filesystem as read-only
VOLUME /app/uploads

# Expose only necessary ports
EXPOSE 8080

# Define entry point
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Secure Docker Runtime Commands

When running containers, apply additional security controls:
```bash
docker run \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  --memory="512m" \
  --cpus="1.0" \
  --security-opt="no-new-privileges" \
  myapp
```

### Hardening Kubernetes

#### Example Pod Security Policies (PSP)
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: restricted
spec:
  privileged: false
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  runAsUser:
    rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: MustRunAs
    ranges:
    - min: 1
      max: 65535
  fsGroup:
    rule: MustRunAs
    ranges:
    - min: 1
      max: 65535
  volumes:
  - 'configMap'
  - 'secret'
```

#### Enforce Pod Security Standards
Configure Kubernetes namespaces with Pod Security Admission:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: secure-namespace
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
```

### CI/CD Integration for Secure Defaults

1. **Image Scanning:**
   - Integrate tools like Trivy to scan images:
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       scan:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - name: Scan Docker image
             run: trivy image myapp:latest
     ```

2. **Policy Enforcement:**
   - Use OPA/Gatekeeper to ensure images meet organizational hardening standards.

---

### Monitoring and Auditing

1. **Runtime Monitoring:**
   - Use **Falco** to detect unexpected behavior:
     ```yaml
     falco_rules:
       - rule: Write below /etc
         desc: "Unexpected write to /etc"
         condition: evt.type = "write" and fd.name startswith "/etc"
         output: "Write below /etc detected (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline)"
         priority: NOTICE
     ```

2. **Log Analysis:**
   - Collect logs with tools like Fluentd, Elasticsearch, or Splunk.

### Benefits of Secure Defaults and Hardening

- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Minimal components and resources limit opportunities for exploitation.
- **Improved Runtime Security:** Proper configuration and restrictions prevent unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- **Enhanced Compliance:** Meets security benchmarks and industry standards.

By combining these practices, you ensure that your containerized applications, hosts, and orchestration tools are secure and resilient against attacks.
