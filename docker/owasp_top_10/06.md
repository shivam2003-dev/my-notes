### Mitigating D06 - Protect Secrets

Secrets like passwords, tokens, private keys, or certificates are critical assets that need to be carefully protected to prevent unauthorized access to your data and services. Improper handling of secrets can lead to severe security breaches.

### Steps to Protect Secrets

#### 1. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:**
   - Never hardcode secrets directly into source code, `Dockerfile`, or environment variables.
   - Use secret management solutions to securely store and retrieve secrets.

#### 2. **Leverage Secret Management Tools:**
   - Use tools like **HashiCorp Vault**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, **Azure Key Vault**, or **Kubernetes Secrets** to store and manage secrets securely.
   - Example: Storing and retrieving a secret using Vault:
     ```bash
     vault kv put secret/db password=mysecurepassword
     vault kv get secret/db
     ```

#### 3. **Encrypt Secrets:**
   - Always encrypt secrets at rest using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
   - Ensure secrets are encrypted in transit using TLS/HTTPS.

#### 4. **Limit Secret Scope:**
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to secrets to only those who need them.
   - Assign specific secrets to specific applications or services, avoiding sharing across environments or services.

#### 5. **Rotate Secrets Regularly:**
   - Implement automatic secret rotation policies to reduce the impact of leaked secrets.
   - For example, rotate database credentials periodically and update the corresponding applications dynamically.

#### 6. **Use Environment Variables Securely:**
   - Pass secrets as environment variables at runtime but avoid defining them in `Dockerfile`.
   - Use orchestration tools to inject secrets dynamically.

#### 7. **Use Docker Secrets:**
   - For Docker Swarm, use Docker Secrets to securely store and use sensitive data.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     echo "mysecurepassword" | docker secret create db_password -
     docker service create --name my_service --secret db_password myapp
     ```

#### 8. **Secure Kubernetes Secrets:**
   - Store secrets in Kubernetes using `Secret` resources.
   - Encrypt secrets at rest by enabling `--encryption-provider-config` for the Kubernetes API server.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: db-secret
     type: Opaque
     data:
       username: YWRtaW4=  # Base64 encoded
       password: c2VjdXJlcGFzc3dvcmQ=
     ```

#### 9. **Monitor Secret Usage:**
   - Use monitoring tools to detect unauthorized or abnormal secret access.
   - Integrate tools like AWS CloudTrail or HashiCorp Vault's audit log for detailed tracking.

#### 10. **Prevent Secret Leaks in CI/CD Pipelines:**
   - Mask secrets in pipeline logs.
   - Use tools like GitHub Actions Secrets or GitLab CI/CD Variables to manage secrets securely.
   - Example for GitHub Actions:
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - name: Deploy
             env:
               DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
             run: ./deploy.sh
     ```

#### 11. **Scan for Secret Leaks:**
   - Use tools like **GitLeaks**, **TruffleHog**, or **Secrets Scanner** to detect exposed secrets in code repositories.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     gitleaks detect --source .
     ```

### Example Secure Docker Workflow

#### Dockerfile (Without Hardcoding Secrets)
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Use environment variables or secret management tools for credentials
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

#### Secure Docker Command
```bash
docker run \
  --env-file .env \
  --read-only \
  --name myapp \
  myapp
```

#### Injecting Secrets Dynamically in Kubernetes
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: myapp:latest
    env:
    - name: DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-secret
          key: password
```

### Monitoring and Alerting for Secrets

1. **Real-Time Secret Access Monitoring:**
   - Use tools like Vault's audit logs to track secret access:
     ```bash
     vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault_audit.log
     ```

2. **Detect Anomalies:**
   - Use runtime security tools like Falco to detect unauthorized access:
     ```yaml
     - rule: Unexpected Secret Access
       desc: Detect unauthorized access to Kubernetes secrets
       condition: evt.type = "open" and fd.name contains "/var/run/secrets"
       output: "Unexpected secret access detected (user=%user.name)"
       priority: WARNING
     ```

### Benefits of Protecting Secrets

1. **Reduced Risk of Unauthorized Access:** Protecting secrets minimizes the chances of unauthorized users accessing sensitive services.
2. **Improved Compliance:** Aligns with regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 for data protection.
3. **Enhanced Operational Security:** Strong secret management practices ensure smoother and more secure deployments.

By following these practices, you can ensure secrets are managed, stored, and used securely, minimizing exposure to threats.
