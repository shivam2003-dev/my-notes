### Mitigating D09 - Follow Immutable Paradigm

The immutable paradigm in containerized environments emphasizes that once a container is deployed and configured, it should not change. This approach helps ensure consistency, reduces the attack surface, and prevents malicious tampering with the container's filesystem. By starting containers in a read-only mode, you prevent any modifications to the container's filesystem, further enhancing its security.

---

### Steps to Follow the Immutable Paradigm

#### 1. **Run Containers in Read-Only Mode:**
   - Set the containerâ€™s filesystem to be read-only to prevent any changes after deployment.
   - Example Docker run command:
     ```bash
     docker run --read-only myimage:latest
     ```

   - This will mount the entire filesystem as read-only, ensuring that the container cannot make changes to its filesystem.

#### 2. **Use Writable Volumes for Mutable Data:**
   - For containers that require writing data (e.g., logs, user uploads), mount specific directories or volumes as read-write, while keeping the rest of the container filesystem read-only.
   - Example Docker run command with writable volumes:
     ```bash
     docker run --read-only \
       -v /path/to/logs:/logs:rw \
       -v /path/to/uploads:/uploads:rw \
       myimage:latest
     ```

#### 3. **Leverage Kubernetes for Immutable Containers:**
   - In Kubernetes, you can define containers with a read-only root filesystem and writable volumes for specific directories.
   - Example Kubernetes deployment configuration:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: myapp
     spec:
       replicas: 1
       template:
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: myapp
             image: myimage:latest
             securityContext:
               readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
             volumeMounts:
             - name: logs
               mountPath: /logs
               readOnly: false
             - name: uploads
               mountPath: /uploads
               readOnly: false
           volumes:
           - name: logs
             persistentVolumeClaim:
               claimName: logs-pvc
           - name: uploads
             persistentVolumeClaim:
               claimName: uploads-pvc
     ```

#### 4. **Use Multi-Stage Builds to Create Immutable Images:**
   - Build the container image in stages, where intermediate stages include only the tools required for building the application, and the final image contains only the essential runtime components. This ensures that the runtime image is minimal and immutable.
   - Example Dockerfile:
     ```dockerfile
     # Build stage
     FROM node:16 AS builder
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN npm install && npm run build

     # Runtime stage
     FROM node:16-slim
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app
     CMD ["node", "app.js"]
     ```

#### 5. **Use Read-Only Filesystems for Docker and Kubernetes Nodes:**
   - For environments where containers need to be as immutable as possible, configure the Docker daemon or Kubernetes nodes to run with read-only filesystems for the container runtime.
   - This reduces the chance of accidental or malicious changes on the node level.

#### 6. **Implement Security Contexts to Enforce Immutability:**
   - In Kubernetes, the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` option enforces immutability on the container's filesystem.
   - Example in a security context:
     ```yaml
     securityContext:
       readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
     ```

#### 7. **Automate Image Integrity Checks:**
   - Use tools like **Notary** or **Cosign** to sign and verify images, ensuring that the image is trusted before running it.
   - Signing the image guarantees that no tampering has occurred, which is critical in an immutable system.

#### 8. **Monitor Changes with Intrusion Detection Systems:**
   - Implement runtime security tools like **Falco** or **Sysdig** to detect unauthorized file system changes or deviations from the immutable state.
   - Example Falco rule to detect changes to a read-only filesystem:
     ```yaml
     - rule: Write to Read-Only Filesystem
       desc: Detect writes to a read-only filesystem
       condition: container.read_only == "true" and not evt.type in ("open", "execve")
       output: "Write detected on a read-only filesystem in container {{container.id}}"
       priority: CRITICAL
     ```

### Example Immutable Docker Workflow

#### Dockerfile for Immutable Image
```dockerfile
# Base image for build
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Minimal runtime image
FROM node:16-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app
COPY --from=builder /app/config /app/config
USER node
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

#### Running Docker in Read-Only Mode
```bash
docker run --read-only \
  -v /path/to/logs:/logs:rw \
  -v /path/to/uploads:/uploads:rw \
  myimage:latest
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment with Immutable Containers
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myimage:latest
          securityContext:
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /logs
              readOnly: false
            - name: uploads
              mountPath: /uploads
              readOnly: false
      volumes:
        - name: logs
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: logs-pvc
        - name: uploads
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: uploads-pvc
```

### Benefits of the Immutable Paradigm

1. **Enhanced Security:** By ensuring containers are read-only, you reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized modifications.
2. **Consistency:** Immutable containers help maintain a consistent environment, preventing configuration drift and unexpected changes.
3. **Easy Rollback:** Immutable containers make it easy to rollback to a known good state by redeploying an earlier image.
4. **Simplified Operations:** With containers designed to be immutable, you can focus on orchestration and monitoring rather than worrying about in-container changes.

By following the immutable paradigm, you ensure that your containers are secure, predictable, and resistant to tampering, providing a strong foundation for running production-grade applications.
