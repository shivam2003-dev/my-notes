### Mitigating D10 - Logging

Proper logging is essential for detecting security events, auditing actions, and maintaining the integrity of your systems. By centralizing, securing, and ensuring the integrity of logs, you can monitor container, host, and orchestration activities effectively. Logs provide crucial insights into unauthorized access, configuration changes, and other security incidents.

### Steps to Ensure Secure and Centralized Logging

#### 1. **Centralize Logs:**
   - Use a centralized logging system such as **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** stack, **Fluentd**, **Graylog**, or cloud-native solutions like **AWS CloudWatch** or **Azure Monitor**.
   - Ensure that all logs from containers, orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes), and the host are forwarded to a central logging service for easier analysis and correlation.
   - Example with Fluentd:
     ```yaml
     # Fluentd Config for Kubernetes logging
     <match **>
       @type elasticsearch
       host elasticsearch.logging.svc.cluster.local
       port 9200
       logstash_format true
     </match>
     ```

#### 2. **Log Security Relevant Events:**
   - Log all relevant security events, such as:
     - Container start/stop events.
     - Failed login attempts (e.g., SSH or API access).
     - Changes to sensitive files or system configurations.
     - Privileged operations or access to critical resources.
     - Network activity and ingress/egress rules.
   - Example for Docker container logs:
     ```bash
     docker logs --details <container_id> --timestamps
     ```

#### 3. **Use Structured Logging:**
   - Ensure logs are structured in a way that makes them machine-readable and easier to search, filter, and analyze. JSON format is commonly used.
   - Example structured logging in a Node.js application:
     ```javascript
     const logger = require('winston');
     logger.add(new logger.transports.Console({
       format: logger.format.json(),
     }));
     logger.info('User login', { user: 'admin', status: 'success' });
     ```

#### 4. **Ensure Remote Logging and Redundancy:**
   - Ensure logs are stored off the host to protect against tampering or loss. Implement log forwarding mechanisms to a remote location.
   - Use syslog, Fluentd, or other log shippers to send logs to a remote server or log management system.
   - Example for Docker logging to a remote syslog server:
     ```bash
     docker run --log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=udp://<syslog_server>:514 myimage
     ```

#### 5. **Include Common Timestamp:**
   - Ensure logs from all systems (host, container, orchestration) share a common timestamp to allow accurate correlation of events.
   - Use **UTC** as the standard timezone for all log timestamps to avoid timezone discrepancies.
   - Example using UTC timestamp in Docker logs:
     ```bash
     docker logs --timestamps --time-format=utc
     ```

#### 6. **Tamper-Proof Logs:**
   - Logs should be made tamper-proof to ensure their integrity. Consider using **Blockchain**-based logging systems or tamper-proof log management tools.
   - Implement log signing mechanisms to verify that logs have not been altered.
   - Example with **Auditd** on Linux (audit daemon for tamper-proof logs):
     ```bash
     auditctl -w /etc/ssh/sshd_config -p wa -k ssh_changes
     ausearch -k ssh_changes
     ```

#### 7. **Enable Application Logging:**
   - Ensure your application logs security events such as authentication attempts, user actions, and critical errors. Logs should be pushed to the central logging service.
   - Example with Docker container logging via a JSON file:
     ```dockerfile
     # Dockerfile to enable application logging
     RUN apt-get install -y rsyslog
     COPY myapp-logs.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/
     ```

#### 8. **Log Aggregation in Kubernetes:**
   - Use tools like **Fluentd** or **Filebeat** to collect logs from Kubernetes pods and nodes.
   - Example for Fluentd in Kubernetes to collect logs:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: fluentd
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: fluentd
         image: fluent/fluentd:v1.12
         volumeMounts:
         - name: varlog
           mountPath: /var/log
       volumes:
       - name: varlog
         hostPath:
           path: /var/log
     ```

#### 9. **Configure Log Rotation:**
   - Set up log rotation to avoid log file bloat. Ensure old logs are archived or deleted in a controlled manner.
   - Example logrotate configuration for Docker logs:
     ```bash
     /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
       rotate 5
       daily
       compress
       delaycompress
       missingok
       notifempty
       copytruncate
     }
     ```

#### 10. **Set Up Alerts and Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring systems to track security events and trigger alerts when suspicious activities are detected in logs. This can be done using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **Elastic Stack**.
   - Example Prometheus alert for failed login attempts:
     ```yaml
     groups:
     - name: login-alerts
       rules:
       - alert: FailedLoginAttempts
         expr: rate(auth_failures_total[5m]) > 5
         for: 5m
         labels:
           severity: critical
         annotations:
           summary: "Too many failed login attempts detected."
     ```

### Example Secure Docker Logging Workflow

1. **Set up Fluentd as a Log Aggregator:**
   - Fluentd collects logs from containers and forwards them to Elasticsearch:
     ```bash
     docker run -d \
       -v /var/log:/var/log \
       -v /etc/rsyslog.conf:/etc/rsyslog.conf \
       --name fluentd \
       fluent/fluentd
     ```

2. **Docker Container Logging to Remote Syslog:**
   - Use the syslog driver for remote logging:
     ```bash
     docker run --log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=udp://<syslog_server>:514 myimage:latest
     ```

3. **Kubernetes Pod Logging Configuration:**
   - Fluentd configuration to capture pod logs:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: myapp-logs
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: myapp
         image: myapp:latest
         volumeMounts:
         - name: logs
           mountPath: /var/log
       volumes:
       - name: logs
         hostPath:
           path: /var/log
     ```

### Benefits of Secure Logging Practices

1. **Improved Security Monitoring:** Centralized, structured, and tamper-proof logs allow faster detection of security incidents.
2. **Compliance and Auditing:** Proper logging helps with meeting industry standards and regulatory requirements like GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA.
3. **Incident Response:** With detailed logs, you can trace security events, perform root cause analysis, and quickly mitigate threats.
4. **Operational Insights:** Centralized logging provides visibility into application behavior, helping to troubleshoot and optimize systems.

By adopting these logging practices, you ensure your containers, hosts, and orchestration systems maintain a high level of security, enabling better monitoring, auditing, and incident response.
