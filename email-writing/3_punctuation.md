## Key Points on Punctuation in Professional Emails

**Apostrophe**
- Use for possession (e.g., Suzi's laptop, Gerry's address)
- Avoid contractions like can't or wouldn't in professional emails

**Exclamation Point**
- Rarely use in professional emails
- Never use more than once

**Commas**
- Use where you naturally pause when reading aloud
- Use with FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to connect sentences
- Use in lists, geographical names, dates, and titles
- Example: "For our meeting later today, I will bring all of the supplies."

**Semicolon**
- Often used incorrectly; avoid if unsure
- Use to join parts of a series when some items already include commas

**Quotation Marks**
- Use only for direct quotes, not for emphasis
- Punctuation rules can be tricky; consult resources like Purdue OWL if necessary

**Emoticons and Text Symbols**
- Do not use in professional emails

**Additional Tips**
- Read emails aloud to check for natural pauses (comma placement)
- Use periods at the end of every sentence (except questions)
- Consult resources like The Owl at Purdue for detailed grammar information

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- Overusing exclamation points
- Misusing semicolons
- Using quotation marks for emphasis
- Mixing informal text message style with professional email writing

By following these guidelines, your emails will be more professionally punctuated and easier to read.
