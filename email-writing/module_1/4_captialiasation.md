## Key Points on Capitalization in Professional Emails

**General Rules**
- Capitalize the first letter of every sentence
- Capitalize proper nouns

**Proper Nouns**
- Capitalize names of unique places or things (e.g., Great Pyramids, Tokyo)
- Capitalize adjectives derived from proper nouns (e.g., French wine, Italian sports cars)

**People and Titles**
- Capitalize official titles when used with names (e.g., Pope Francis, Queen Elizabeth, President Obama)
- Capitalize "The" when referring to a specific person (e.g., The Pope, The Queen)
- Don't capitalize occupations (e.g., coach Ellis, team owner Malcolm Glazer)

**Media Titles**
- Capitalize newspapers and magazines (e.g., New York Times, Vanity Fair)
- For book and movie titles:
  - Capitalize all words except prepositions (e.g., Lord of the Rings)
  - Capitalize prepositions if they're at the beginning of the title

**Brand Names**
- Capitalize brand names even at the beginning of a sentence (e.g., iPhone, eBay)

**Exceptions and Special Cases**
- Capitalize "The" in newspaper names (e.g., The New York Times)
- Don't capitalize "the" when referring to a general position (e.g., "the president will travel")

By following these capitalization rules, you'll present a more professional image in your emails and avoid potentially offending recipients by incorrectly writing their names, companies, or cities.
