- Introduces the author and purpose
- Two ways to present the author:
  1. Name, position, and organization (for first-time emails)
  2. Pronoun (for subsequent emails)
- Includes a controlling idea that expresses the email's purpose

### Development
- Expands on the email's purpose in detail
- Organize by answering WH questions about the topic
- Plan content by writing down relevant WH questions

### Conclusion
- Usually one sentence
- Shows appreciation or positivity
- Use specific verbs for:
  - Appreciation: thank, appreciate, be glad about
