## Key Points for Writing Request Emails

**Polite Language for Requests**

- Use "please" to make sentences more polite:
  - "Please send me your resume."
  - "Please meet me today at 3 PM."

- Use question forms with "could" and "would":
  - "Could you send me your resume?"
  - "Would you give me directions to your office?"

- Add "please" to questions for extra politeness:
  - "Could you please send me your resume?"
  - Place "please" right before the verb

**Additional Polite Expressions**

- "Would you mind" + verb-ing:
  - "Would you mind sending me your resume?"
  - "Would you mind meeting me today at 3 PM?"

- "Would like" instead of "want":
  - "I would like to meet you at 3 PM."
  - "I would like the directions to your office."

**Making Multiple Requests**

- Number requests:
  1. Please send your resume.
  2. Please include three references.

- Or use "also" for the second request:
  - "Please send me your resume. Could you also include three references?"
  - Place "also" right before the verb

**Concluding the Email**

- Simple thanks: "Thank you" or "Sincere thanks"
- More polite: Add the reason for your thanks
- Example: "Thank you for your time and consideration."

**Email Structure**
1. Make polite request(s)
2. Add words of appreciation
3. Include closing and signature

By using these polite expressions and structures, you can write more effective and professional request emails.
