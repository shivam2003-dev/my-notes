## Key Points on Age and Gender Considerations in Professional Emails

### Age Considerations

- In American culture, age often does not strongly influence how you address someone
- Other factors like title or relationship are more important
- Be respectful and polite regardless of age difference

**Do's:**
- Use respectful terms like Mr., Ms., Mrs. or official titles if known
- Maintain a professional tone

**Don'ts:**
- Use slang words
- Make excessive references to pop culture

### Gender Considerations

- In American culture, gender usually does not play a significant role in communication
- Other cultures may have different norms regarding gender in communication

**Best Practices:**
- Keep language gender-neutral
- Avoid gender-biased thoughts or expressions
- Use titles rather than Mr./Ms./Mrs. if unsure of gender

### General Tips

- Consider your audience when writing any email, especially in a business context
- Review your email before sending to check for potential misunderstandings
- Be aware of cultural differences that may affect interpretation
