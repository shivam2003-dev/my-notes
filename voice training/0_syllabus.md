### **Syllabus Details**

#### **Week 1: Foundation – Understanding and Strengthening Your Voice**
- **Goal**: Build awareness of your voice, posture, and breathing.
- **Focus**: Diaphragmatic breathing, vocal warm-ups, and posture.

| **Day** | **What to Do**                          | **How to Improve**                                             | **What I Think**                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Record your voice (natural speech).     | Listen to your tone, pace, and clarity; note areas for improvement. | Reflect on areas where you feel your voice lacks confidence or clarity.         |
| 2       | Learn diaphragmatic breathing.         | Practice deep breathing: inhale for 4 sec, hold for 4 sec, exhale for 6 sec. | Diaphragmatic breathing improves vocal strength and reduces strain.             |
| 3       | Warm-up with humming exercises.        | Hum softly for 5 minutes to relax your vocal cords.            | Humming helps develop vocal resonance and prepares your voice.                  |
| 4       | Posture alignment practice.            | Stand straight with shoulders relaxed, chin parallel to the floor. | Proper posture enhances vocal projection and confidence.                        |
| 5       | Articulation drills (tongue twisters). | Practice “Red lorry, yellow lorry” and others slowly.          | Articulation enhances clarity and speech precision.                             |
| 6       | Lip trills (vocal strength exercise).  | Blow air through your lips while vocalizing a sound.           | Lip trills build control and improve resonance.                                 |
| 7       | Re-record and review progress.         | Compare your new recording with Day 1’s recording.             | Analyzing progress helps identify areas that improved and those needing focus.  |

#### **Week 2: Resonance and Projection**
- **Goal**: Develop a fuller, more resonant voice with better projection.
- **Focus**: Vocal exercises for resonance, volume, and control.

| **Day** | **What to Do**                              | **How to Improve**                                                    | **What I Think**                                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8       | Practice vowel sounds (“A, E, I, O, U”).    | Elongate each vowel for 5 seconds. Focus on resonance in the chest and head. | Vowel exercises enhance vocal quality and resonance.                           |
| 9       | Resonance exercise (singing scales).        | Sing scales softly, feeling vibrations in the chest and head.          | Resonance strengthens vocal depth and richness.                                |
| 10      | Use a resonator straw for vocal exercises.  | Speak or hum through a straw for 5 minutes.                           | The straw technique improves airflow and vocal efficiency.                     |
| 11      | Practice voice projection.                  | Speak to a distant object as if addressing a crowd.                   | Projection ensures your voice carries without strain.                          |
| 12      | Resonant humming with consonants.           | Hum while vocalizing “mm” and “ng.”                                    | Consonant exercises help develop richer, resonant tones.                       |
| 13      | Record a speech with projected voice.       | Deliver a prepared script while maintaining projection.                | Self-review to ensure volume and clarity.                                      |
| 14      | Analyze recordings and adjust technique.    | Identify areas of weakness, like breathiness or lack of resonance.     | Regular feedback is crucial for improvement.                                   |

#### **Week 3: Clarity and Expression**
- **Goal**: Refine articulation, pace, and emotional expression.

|---------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 15      | Practice clear articulation.                    | Exaggerate pronunciation of words like “butter” and “important.”      | Improved clarity ensures your message is understood.                           |
| 16      | Work on speech pacing.                          | Read aloud slowly, then gradually increase speed.                     | Controlled pacing makes your voice engaging and powerful.                      |
| 17      | Eliminate fillers (“um,” “uh”).                 | Record and identify filler words; replace them with deliberate pauses. | Reducing fillers makes your voice more confident.                              |
| 18      | Emotional expression exercises.                 | Read a passage, emphasizing different emotions (joy, anger, sadness). | Expression adds depth and relatability to your speech.                         |
| 19      | Inflection and tone variety.                    | Practice rising and falling tones on sentences for better engagement. | Tone variety keeps listeners attentive and adds personality to your voice.     |
| 20      | Power words and phrases practice.               | Use power words like “believe,” “achieve,” and “strength.”            | Strong language amplifies your vocal confidence.                               |
| 21      | Record and analyze expressive speaking.         | Assess whether your voice conveys emotion and conviction.             | Evaluate how well your expression aligns with the message.                     |
